    Retrieves rows pertaining to the given keys from the Table instance

      keys (str): A sequence of strings representing the key of each table row to fetch.
      other_silly_variable (float): Another optional :math:`\\mu^\\frac{\\theta}{3}`

    Returns:
      A dict mapping keys to the corresponding table row data
      fetched. Each row is represented as a tuple of strings. For
      example: ``some in line shitty code``
