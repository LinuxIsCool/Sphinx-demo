    Args:
      big_table (int): An open Bigtable Table instance.
      keys (str): A sequence of strings representing the key of each table row to fetch.
      other_silly_variable (float): Another optional :math:`\\mu^\\frac{\\theta}{3}`

    Returns:
      A dict mapping keys to the corresponding table row data
      fetched. Each row is represented as a tuple of strings. For
      example: ``some in line demoty code``

      .. math::
         (a + b)^2 &= a^2 + 2ab + b^2 \\\\
                  &= \\sum_{i=0}^{\\infty} f(x) dx

         (a - b)^1 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2

      If a key from the keys argument is missing from the dictionary,
      then that row was not found in the table.

    Raises:
      IOError: An error occurred accessing the bigtable.Table object.
